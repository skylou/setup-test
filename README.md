# Welcome to Tipalti Approve Task! ðŸ¤–

This is a test project to prepare your environement for the on site exercise.

## Project

To run the project, you need to run server and client at the same time from 2 different terminals.

### Client

Client code is located in `client` folder. It's based on [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

### Server

Server is located in corresponding `server` folder. It has NodeJS and Python implementations.

### Goals

#### Client

You should have node installed
Make sure you manage to launch the client app as indicated in client Readme.

#### Server

Choose either Python or NodeJS environment.\
In both case make sure you manage to launch the web server (see Readme files).\
Python Note: make sure you run the flask app from the virtual environemnt ('venv/bin/run').\
Once running, calling the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:3001/_api/do-stuff should return "Hello World".\
You can use PostMan to check your server is up with this endpoint.
